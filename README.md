# Embedded-vehicle-blackbox-for-telematics-and-parameter-logging
Embedded vehicle blackbox for telematics and parameter logging.

Our project aims to design an embedded black box system for vehicles that uses LoRa to remotely transmit critical vehicle parameters for telematics and accident analysis. It collects, logs, and transmits data like speed, location, acceleration, braking, and crash information for monitoring, idling time,& diagnostics purposes. We will use CAN, v2v communications, telematics, GPS/GSM modules and LORA-WAN
